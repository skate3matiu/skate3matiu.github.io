<p>The things you will need for this tutorial are: <br> USB Stick (Formatted to FAT32) <br> Computer/Laptop <br>
A PS3 (Doesnt have to be jailbroken) <br>
 </p>
<p>Thats all you will need, if you need to know what FAT32 is... google it and find out.</p>
<p>First step is to download the skater you want, put it on the directory of your USB stick and when it is done downloading it unzip the file and if you are in the USA use the BLUS file but if you are in any another place use the BLES file.
Put the USB stick in the right USB slot of your PS3 and turn on your PS3, go to the games tab on the XMB and find "Save Data Utility" click on it and find "USB Devices" then find your save data and press select it then press "Copy" and overwrite your current save data with this file instead.
